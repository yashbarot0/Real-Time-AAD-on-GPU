# GPU AAD Implementation Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing a high-performance GPU-accelerated Adjoint Algorithmic Differentiation (AAD) system for real-time financial derivatives pricing and Greeks computation. The system builds upon the successful CPU AAD implementation and leverages CUDA 12.9 for GPU acceleration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: GPU AAD Core Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a quantitative developer, I want a GPU-accelerated AAD system that can compute option prices and Greeks in parallel, so that I can achieve 5-50x speedup over CPU implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GPU AAD system is initialized THEN it SHALL allocate GPU memory for tape operations, values, and adjoints
2. WHEN AAD operations are recorded THEN the system SHALL build a computational graph on GPU memory
3. WHEN reverse-mode differentiation is executed THEN it SHALL propagate gradients in parallel across GPU threads
4. IF GPU memory allocation fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to CPU processing
5. WHEN GPU operations complete THEN results SHALL be copied back to host memory with error checking

### Requirement 2: Black-Scholes GPU Kernel Implementation

**User Story:** As a risk manager, I want to compute Black-Scholes option prices and all Greeks (Delta, Vega, Gamma, Theta, Rho) for thousands of scenarios simultaneously on GPU, so that I can perform real-time portfolio risk analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Black-Scholes parameters are provided THEN the GPU kernel SHALL compute option prices using the proven step-by-step method from CPU implementation
2. WHEN the forward pass completes THEN the system SHALL automatically compute all Greeks via AAD reverse pass
3. WHEN processing batch scenarios THEN each GPU thread SHALL handle one complete option calculation independently
4. WHEN mathematical functions (log, exp, sqrt, norm_cdf) are called THEN they SHALL use optimized device implementations
5. IF numerical instability occurs THEN the system SHALL handle edge cases (zero volatility, negative time, etc.) gracefully

### Requirement 3: Memory Management and Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want the GPU AAD system to efficiently manage memory and achieve maximum throughput, so that the system can handle institutional-scale workloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GPU memory is allocated THEN it SHALL use unified memory or explicit memory management for optimal performance
2. WHEN processing large batches THEN the system SHALL use memory coalescing patterns for efficient GPU memory access
3. WHEN tape operations are recorded THEN they SHALL minimize atomic operations and memory contention
4. WHEN kernel launches occur THEN they SHALL use optimal block and grid dimensions for target GPU architecture
5. WHEN memory transfers happen THEN they SHALL use asynchronous operations with CUDA streams for overlap

### Requirement 4: Batch Processing and Real-Time Integration

**User Story:** As a trading system developer, I want to process thousands of option scenarios in real-time batches, so that I can integrate GPU AAD with live market data feeds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN market data arrives THEN the system SHALL queue scenarios for batch GPU processing
2. WHEN batch size reaches threshold THEN GPU kernels SHALL be launched automatically
3. WHEN GPU processing completes THEN results SHALL be available for immediate consumption
4. WHEN processing multiple batches THEN the system SHALL use double-buffering to hide latency
5. IF real-time deadlines are missed THEN the system SHALL provide performance monitoring and alerts

### Requirement 5: Validation and Testing Framework

**User Story:** As a quantitative analyst, I want comprehensive validation that GPU results match CPU results with high precision, so that I can trust the GPU implementation for production use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GPU AAD computes Greeks THEN results SHALL match CPU AAD within numerical tolerance (1e-10)
2. WHEN analytical Black-Scholes formulas are available THEN GPU results SHALL match analytical values
3. WHEN edge cases are tested THEN the system SHALL handle extreme parameter values correctly
4. WHEN performance benchmarks run THEN GPU SHALL achieve 5-50x speedup over CPU baseline
5. WHEN stress testing occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain accuracy under high-throughput conditions

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Robustness

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust error handling and monitoring capabilities, so that the GPU AAD system can operate reliably in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CUDA errors occur THEN the system SHALL detect and report specific error codes
2. WHEN GPU memory is exhausted THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to CPU processing
3. WHEN kernel launches fail THEN the system SHALL retry with different parameters or fallback
4. WHEN numerical errors are detected THEN the system SHALL log warnings and continue processing
5. WHEN system monitoring is enabled THEN it SHALL track GPU utilization, memory usage, and throughput metrics

### Requirement 7: Integration with Existing CPU System

**User Story:** As a software architect, I want seamless integration between GPU and CPU AAD implementations, so that the system can dynamically choose the optimal processing method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL detect available GPU capabilities and configure accordingly
2. WHEN workload size is small THEN the system SHALL automatically use CPU processing for efficiency
3. WHEN workload size is large THEN the system SHALL automatically use GPU processing for performance
4. WHEN GPU is unavailable THEN the system SHALL transparently fallback to CPU implementation
5. WHEN both implementations are available THEN the system SHALL provide configuration options for selection

### Requirement 8: Real-Time Data Feed Integration

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the GPU AAD system to integrate with real-time market data feeds, so that I can get live option prices and Greeks updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN market data updates arrive THEN the system SHALL trigger GPU batch processing automatically
2. WHEN multiple symbols are processed THEN each SHALL maintain independent computational graphs
3. WHEN Greeks are computed THEN they SHALL be available within milliseconds of data arrival
4. WHEN data feeds are interrupted THEN the system SHALL continue with last known values and alert users
5. WHEN historical data is replayed THEN the system SHALL process it at accelerated speeds for backtesting
